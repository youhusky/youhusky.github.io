Native American tribes such as the Navajo, Zuni, Hopi have used turquoise in their silver jewelry for hundreds of years. Silver Rings, bangles, cuffs, concha belts, bola neckties, squash blossoms, pendants and other tribal Native American jewelry pieces have been adorned with blue turquoise, green turquoise, and together with lapis, mother of pearl, jet, onyx and coral in fine inlay work. \r\nIn the early days, Turquoise was abundant and the finest specimens were used in the older items of Indian Tribal turquoise jewelry. Today, most of the mines in the American Southwest are depleted and today&#39;s Navajo, Zuni and Hopi artists use turquoise from China and Persia. One way collectors are able to find some of the old turquoise favorites such as Sleeping Beauty Turquoise, Bisbee Turquoise, Spiderweb Turquoise, Lander Blue Turquoise, Lone Mountain Turquoise, Number 8 Turquoise, Kingman, Fox, Cripple Creek is by finding an Old Pawn or Vintage Native American jewelry piece with an old gemstone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: We get our merchandise from our chain of 10 pawnshops operating in the Southwest as well as from buyers out on the road.

The 16x24 and 24x36 are printed âfull bleedâ which means we print the image right to the paper edge, so there is no white border (unless itâs an odd proportion â for instance, if the image is square, and you purchase a 24x36 print, you will receive a 24x24 print).","price":"7.99","currency_code":"USD"},{"id":228396783,"title":"Unakite Heart Stone - Large Green Unakite Heart Stone - Gemstone Hearts","images":["https://img0.etsystatic.com/061/1/7632577/il_75x75.750999088_ccoi.jpg","https://img0.etsystatic.com/061/1/7632577/il_170x135.750999088_ccoi.jpg","https://img0.etsystatic.com/061/1/7632577/il_570xN.750999088_ccoi.jpg","https://img0.etsystatic.com/061/1/7632577/il_fullxfull.750999088_ccoi.jpg"],"description":"Solid Unakite stone shaped into a puffy heart.\r\n \r\nRich green with peach color and a high polish.\r\nA beautiful hand size heart stone.\r\n\r\n44mm wide x 38mm long x 22mm thick\r\nweighs 65.9 grams \r\n\r\nships in a nice gift box\r\n\r\nMetric Conversion:\r\n1/2 inch = 12 mm\r\n1 inch = 25 mm\r\n2 inch = 50 mm\r\n3 inch = 75 mm\r\n4 inch = 100 mm\r\n\r\n(a US Quarter is 25mm = 1 inch)\r\n\r\n\r\nto see more of my stones and crystals, click on this link\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/SequoiasRoots?section_id=13480265\r\n\r\n#14996","price":"17.00","currency_code":"USD"},{"id":219852973,"title":"Midi Ring Set of 5 // Adjustable Bands // Stackable Jewelry // Light Silver / Gold / Copper","images":["https://img1.etsystatic.com/055/1/7654056/il_75x75.716897013_amay.jpg","https://img1.etsystatic.com/055/1/7654056/il_170x135.716897013_amay.jpg","https://img1.etsystatic.com/055/1/7654056/il_570xN.716897013_amay.jpg","https://img1.etsystatic.com/055/1/7654056/il_fullxfull.716897013_amay.jpg"],"description":"Knuckle Ring Set of 5, Adjustable Basic Band Midi Stackable Jewelry in Light Silver, Gold or Copper\n\nOne set includes 5 rings total:\n\n5 Basic Band Rings\n\nBack of rings are open for adjusting to fit multiple fingers.

Native American tribes such as the Navajo, Zuni, Hopi have used turquoise in their silver jewelry for hundreds of years. Silver Rings, bangles, cuffs, concha belts, bola neckties, squash blossoms, pendants and other tribal Native American jewelry pieces have been adorned with blue turquoise, green turquoise, and together with lapis, mother of pearl, jet, onyx and coral in fine inlay work. \r\nIn the early days, Turquoise was abundant and the finest specimens were used in the older items of Indian Tribal turquoise jewelry. Today, most of the mines in the American Southwest are depleted and today&#39;s Navajo, Zuni and Hopi artists use turquoise from China and Persia. One way collectors are able to find some of the old turquoise favorites such as Sleeping Beauty Turquoise, Bisbee Turquoise, Spiderweb Turquoise, Lander Blue Turquoise, Lone Mountain Turquoise, Number 8 Turquoise, Kingman, Fox, Cripple Creek is by finding an Old Pawn or Vintage Native American jewelry piece with an old gemstone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: We get our merchandise from our chain of 10 pawnshops operating in the Southwest as well as from buyers out on the road.

One way collectors are able to find some of the old turquoise favorites such as Sleeping Beauty Turquoise, Bisbee Turquoise, Spiderweb Turquoise, Lander Blue Turquoise, Lone Mountain Turquoise, Number 8 Turquoise, Kingman, Fox, Cripple Creek is by finding an Old Pawn or Vintage Native American jewelry piece with an old gemstone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: We get our merchandise from our chain of 10 pawnshops operating in the Southwest as well as from buyers out on the road.

My husband and I had two wonderful boys and after eight years of trying,..we were blessed with a little girl. When she was born, the nurse placed the generic blue and pink striped hospital beenie on her head and I quickly took it off to replace it with an adorable girly beenie from my hospital bag. I quickly went thru three beenies that I brought from home and realized none of them would stay on her head. So,.. to my dismay, my 9 months of âthinking pinkâ was halted as Scarlett Adair adorned the blue/pink striped hospital beenie. I posted hospital pictures of her & because her name is âAdairâ,â¦ no one could tell her gender. The light bulb went off and I set a goal to make gender appropriate hospital beenies~ not only would this solve the problem of newborn beenies that donât fit appropriately,..it would also distinguish the boys from the girls!

If you would prefer your pendant on a long 28 inch chain that hangs down low, just message me and I can switch it out. (Or if you would prefer to measure yourself and let me know exactly how long you would like your chain, I will be happy to make a custom length chain just for you.)\n\n*NOTE* No Butterflies are harmed in the making of my jewelry! All butterflies are raised on butterfly farms and sanctuaries and allowed to live their full lifespan, which averages about 1 month, and then collected and sold so that their beauty can live on! Butterfly Farming actually helps to preserve rain forests and also assures the survival of natural butterfly habitats. Native people are encouraged to grow plants and raise insects opposed to clearing land for cash crops. A portion of my profits are donated to the Rainforest Alliance, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving the Rainforest and the many species that live within it, including the Blue Morpho Butterfly!","price":"32.00","currency_code":"USD"},{"id":128035122,"title":"Celebrity Style Large Bamboo Earrings with  Yellow Gold or 14K Gold Filled  - as Hilary Duff, Kim Kardishian and Rhianna","images":["https://img0.etsystatic.com/050/0/6743649/il_75x75.722246058_qbd4.jpg","https://img0.etsystatic.com/050/0/6743649/il_170x135.722246058_qbd4.jpg","https://img0.etsystatic.com/050/0/6743649/il_570xN.722246058_qbd4.jpg","https://img0.etsystatic.com/050/0/6743649/il_fullxfull.722246058_qbd4.jpg"],"description":"Celebrity style large bamboo hoop earrings as seen on TV. \nAvailable in 24K gold overlay or Brazilian gold filled.\nWear it at any occasion as stars do: \nHilary Duff, Kim Kardishian and Rhianna are one of them who seem to find these new earrings hot.\n\nMetal options:\n1.

This is a tricky measurement to take, so if you are unsure I would recommend heading over to your local piercing parlor, I&#39;m sure they will be happy to help! â¨\r\n\r\nFor your reference, the model has delicate features and her piercing is located quite central on her nostril. The inner diameter of hoop she is wearing above is 6.5mm, outer diameter 7.7mm. Size options required at checkout are for the INNER DIAMETER. Please contact me should you have any further questions for determining your size! \r\n\r\nUp to 10mm inner diameter is included in this listing price.

Happy Unicorn Sprinkle Medley is a one of a kind mix of some of the most magical sprinkles in the universe: jewel-toned violet, turquoise, pink and yellow jimmies (strands), white/yellow/pink/purple star quins and confetti quins, yellow nonpareils and more. \n\nThis listing is for the 8 oz size bottle, which is NET WT 5.8 oz/165 g. Since I believe we all need more sprinkles in our lives, both sizes offered are much larger than store-bought jars and bottles (those typically range between 2-4 oz in volume). That means that each bottle HAS FROM 2-8+ TIMES MORE THAN A STANDARD JAR of sprinkles, which is not only convenient, but much more affordable. \n\nAll of the sprinkles in this mix are candy-sweet and yummy on their own. This sprinkle mix is the perfect way to make any cake, cupcake, cookie, ice cream sandwich, chocolate bark or pretty much anything party-ready. This medley is a unicorn dream in a bottle! \n\nThis sprinkle medley is packaged in an adorable French square clear plastic 8 oz bottle and finished with a glossy label. My sprinkle bottles are LISTED BY VOLUME (Medium 8 oz and Jumbo 16 oz), and the sprinkle labels on the bottles display net weight in oz as well as grams. \n\nSHIPPING: If you are are ordering several bottles of of sprinkles shipping can add up quickly, but once I ship your order and the shipping cost has been confirmed, I will issue you a refund if you have overpaid. \n\nSTORING: I recommend storing any kind of sprinkle in an airtight container in a cool dry place, away from sunlight (colors may fade with prolonged exposure to the sun) for up to 12 months. \n\nQUANTITY: If you need more than the 8 oz size bottle, please see this listing for the jumbo 16 oz size bottle of Happy Unicorn Sprinkle Medley: \n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/236869947/happy-unicorn-sprinkle-medley-colorful?ref=listing-shop-header-3\n\nIf you need more than the jumbo size, please contact me and I can package a larger quantity for you. \n\nCUSTOM: Please contact me if you would like me to create your very own sprinkle medley theme or color scheme! \n\nTHE FINE PRINT: \n\nPlease note that every batch is unique and may vary slightly from the images shown. Also note that all computer monitors display colors differently, but I have taken special care to photograph the sprinkles the most accurate way possible. \n\nBecause the sprinkles used range from my homemade sprinkles to sourced manufactured sprinkles, I cannot guarantee they are certifiably peanut-free. \n\nPlease note that bottles are filled to the brim upon packaging, but some sprinkles may settle during shipping process. \n\nYour purchase is a binding agreement, so please be sure about your selection before checking out. \n\nI do not offer returns or exchanges on sprinkles for health & safety reasons. Thank you for understanding. \n\nPlease take the time to read my shop policies before finalizing your purchase: https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/Sweetapolita/policy?ref=shopinfo_policies_leftnav\n\nThank you so much for visiting my shop.

First you will need to take one of the micro links and place it onto the hair hook.  Then using the hair hook select a small section of hair (best if under a layer of hair or behind the ear to hide the link) and hook the hair hook onto the hair. \r\n\r\n2.  Next slide the micro link over the end of the hook, and around the hair at the root.  Once you have your micro link around a piece of hair simply slide the tip of the Featherhead into the link. \r\n\r\n3.  Using the hair extension clamp apply gentle pressure onto the micro link to hold the extension in place.  It is important to make sure the adhesive tip is under the link when you clamp it down. This ensures that the extension will remain in place, and single feathers wonât fall out. Once the link is clamped down firmly, trim the tip of the feather hair extension with a scissors if necessary.","price":"4.95","currency_code":"USD"},{"id":171890938,"title":"Printable Robot Wall Art DIY Personalized Art  Digital Printable Art -  8 x 10","images":["https://img0.etsystatic.com/029/0/5839909/il_75x75.603408768_kcyu.jpg","https://img0.etsystatic.com/029/0/5839909/il_170x135.603408768_kcyu.jpg","https://img0.etsystatic.com/029/0/5839909/il_570xN.603408768_kcyu.jpg","https://img0.etsystatic.com/029/0/5839909/il_fullxfull.603408768_kcyu.jpg"],"description":"Printable Instant Personalized Art!!!

Not many Luc Yen spinels on the market these days, so this is a rare find. It measures 7 x 5.8 mm. It is VS1 clarity (any spots you can see in the last two photos is from the stone sticking to my finger). It is precision cut, which gives it nice luster and diamond-like sparkle. The color is a very pretty medium-light lavender pink (and a bit more satulated than my pictures were able to capture). Spinel is completely natural and untreated. \r\n\r\nSpinels are not widely known in the jewelry market because good spinels are fairly rare. However, they make excellent choices for engagement rings because they are very durable and suitable for daily wear, they have high refractive index and are more sparkly than sapphires, they are untreated in any way, and they are priced much better than comparable sapphires (although their prices are going up very quickly lately). Very few spinels are coming out of Vietnam, and they are well known for their crisp cryltal and beautiful colors (without any undesirable gray). \r\nThis spinel would make an excellent stone for an engagement ring with a diamond halo or a rose gold milgrain bezel stacking ring (as we have in other listings).\r\n\r\nBenefits of buying a special gem from us:\r\n-We are happy to provide additional photos or videos, to help you make a decision\r\n-We offer a 5-day inspection period. If you are not satisfied for any reason, you can return the gem in its original undamaged condition for a full refund (buyer pays return shipping).\r\n-We will be happy to design a special jewelry piece for you using this gem. You can return the gem to us at any time and we will give you credit of 20% of the gem&#39;s price towards the cost of the mount.\r\n-If you don&#39;t see what you are looking for in the listings, please contact us and we will be happy to source your special gem for you.\r\n-We can get a report from AGL or GIA on your request.

After his discovery, he registered the find in the mineral records of Britain. His discovery was published in 1964, and the material was named pietersite. Currently there are only two known sources of pietersit: African and Chinese. Pietersite is considered a type of tiger&#39;s eye, having the same properties as tiger&#39;s eye but with different patterns due to its brecciated formation.\r\n\r\nThe fibrous structure in pietersite has been folded, stressed, even fractured and/or broken apart via the Earth&#39;s geologic processes. The fibrous materials have then been reformed and naturally recemented together by quartz. Stones and crystals that go through this process are referred to as brecciated, creating a finished product with multiple colors, hues and superb chatoyancy. While pietersite has the lovely chatoyancy of tiger eye, it is not found in continuously structured bands. Rather it can form in swirls, swathes and fibrous (sometimes linear) segments. Thus the structure of the fibrous streaks in pietersite may appear rather chaotic, and can flow or exist in many directions side-by-side like bold paint strokes.\r\n\r\nAfrican pietersite is the most sought after pietersite due to its wide rage of colors. Colors include various blues, golds and reds, that may appear together or alone. Blue is the rarest color, followed by red. The blues range from a baby blue to dark midnight hue. Golds can be light to very deep and rich, sometimes having a reddish hue. All fibrous color variations will have a superb and striking chatoyancy, the bright and subtly changing shimmer of color that moves along the surface of a gemstone as it is viewed from varying angles.\r\n\r\nChinese pietersite is said to have been discovered in 1993, but did not come to market until 1997. Chinese pietersite exhibits a slightly different variations in color and patterns from the pietersite found in Africa. Its colors are primarily golden and bronze, as seen in the pictures to the right, but can also be found in blue shades.","price":"6.19","currency_code":"USD"},{"id":102915097,"title":"6mm Safety eyes Doll eyes Toy eyes Doll Parts Animal eyes Plush eyes Teddy Bears eyes Plastic eyes - Black - 10 pairs BR10","images":["https://img1.etsystatic.com/036/0/6699298/il_75x75.581956023_n3ln.jpg","https://img1.etsystatic.com/036/0/6699298/il_170x135.581956023_n3ln.jpg","https://img1.etsystatic.com/036/0/6699298/il_570xN.581956023_n3ln.jpg","https://img1.etsystatic.com/036/0/6699298/il_fullxfull.581956023_n3ln.jpg"],"description":"safety eyes, black eyes, animal eyes, plastic eyes, craft eyes, teddy bear eyes, stuffed eyes, plush eyes, amigurumi eyes, doll parts, DIY, doll making supply, doll accessories, eyes for doll, toy eyes, eyes for animal, eyes for sale, stuffed toys, stuffed animals\n\nThe eyes will come with plastic washers,they are high quality,easy to install by hand, tight and safe.\n\nQuantity: 10 pairs(20pcs)\nDimensions: 6mm\nColor: black\nMaterial: plastic\n\nThe eyes are 6mm, suitable for 15-20cm dolls,you may also need other accessories for your doll:\nnoses:\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/COLINCJH?section_id=11465017&ref=shopsection_leftnav_8&ga_search_query=4mm\njoints:\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/232787463/teddy-bear-doll-joints-doll-parts-doll?ref=shop_home_active_9\n\nWe have this black eyes in 1.8mm-24mm,if you want other sizes,please check this listing:\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/COLINCJH/search?search_query=Samples+Safety+Teddy+Bear+Black+Eyes+With+Plastic+Washers+&order=date_desc&view_type=list&ref=shop_search\n\nWe also have other kind of eyes in 6mm, maybe you will like them:\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/COLINCJH/search?search_query=6mm&order=date_desc&view_type=gallery&ref=shop_search\n\nWe do wholesale,if the size or quantity you want is not available in my shop, please feel free to request a custom order or send me a message.\n\nWe usually ship orders within 48 hours after payment to your ETSY address,please double check.We ship to worldwide by HongKong Post Air Mail,if your order more than $50,will be sent with a tracking number,if your order less than $50,but you want the order be sent with a tracking number,please take the following listing to pay the shipping fee:\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/208945023/shipping-fee-for-china-post-or-hongkong?ref=shop_home_feat_2\n\nThe time of International shipping depends on many factors, such as Customs clearance, weather, domestic transfer, local post delivery and so on.

But did you know its origins had little to do with warfare? Bayonets were actually invented out of necessity by some of the earliest wild boar hunters. See, boars are infamous for their razor sharp tusks and a willingness to defend themselves, even to the death. If a hunter was to miss his shot or only wounded the boar, a death-charge was always imminent.\n\nWith an instinct to always run towards the gunshots, wild boars are characteristically covered in scars; which is why we love it when we can get our hands on some authentic hides. No two sections of boar hide will ever look the same. If you have been eyeing our Shave Bag, DOPP/Toiletry Bag, or Mini Bag but still need just a bit more enticement; I think you found it.\n\nEach bag is carefully hand-cut and stitched using only authentic wild boar hide. The integrity of our hide is complemented by the bagâs interior black nylon lining engineered to be both durable and cleanable, making this the last bag you will need to ever buy. The bag comes personalized with your choice of initials.\n\n\n\n\n----Stats----\nLeather: Boar\nLiner: Black Water Resistant Nylon\nZipper: Heavy Duty Brass YKK \nSaddle Stitching and Embroidery Color: Cream \n\nMeasurements:\nSmall Shaving Bag 9x2x2      no handle option \nStandard Dopp Kit 9x4x4       option w/ or w/out handle \nX-Large Dopp Kit 10x5x5       option w/ or w/out handle\n\n\n\n---Personalization---\nMake this as unique as you. \nWe personalize for FREE so, please send the initials in first, middle, last format to be embroidered on the FRONT your items in the âcomments sectionâ when ordering.\n\nThe tab on the side has room for two initials. If you would like specific initials, let me know in the notes to seller and I will make it happen. If not otherwise informed, I will make the bag look as good as I possibly can. I embroider the first and last initial that is listed in the notes to seller. \n\nExample: Ty Randle Bowman \nInitials on the bag would be TRB\nInitials on the tab would be TB\n\n\nClick the link below and see how to personalize your bag even more.\n=== www.etsy.com/listing/161703293/custom-lining-for-your-handmade-mens\n\n\n---Shipping & Gift Wrapping---\nAll things hand-crafted and custom-made take time, this is not a cheeseburger from McDonalds.

It is a more economical way to get the beauty of 14K gold. Gold-filled items are 50 to 100,000 times thicker than regular gold plating and will last for years.","price":"22.50","currency_code":"USD"},{"id":210261973,"title":"Woody Phone Case Galaxy S5 S4 iPhone 4 5 6 Plus 5c 5s 4S","images":["https://img0.etsystatic.com/049/0/5174972/il_75x75.678992008_f70l.jpg","https://img0.etsystatic.com/049/0/5174972/il_170x135.678992008_f70l.jpg","https://img0.etsystatic.com/049/0/5174972/il_570xN.678992008_f70l.jpg","https://img0.etsystatic.com/049/0/5174972/il_fullxfull.678992008_f70l.jpg"],"description":"Â©Hyla Waldron\r\nHylaWaldron.com\r\n\r\nThe new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 PLUS Cases come in two styles, our original Slim Case for the careful carrier and the newly introduced Tough Case for the more adventurous customers. \r\n\r\nThe Tough Cases are constructed as a two-piece, impact resistant, flexible plastic case with an extremely slim profile and extra shock dispersion.

All this talk of aluminum, and other questionable ingredients, has given me the heeby-jeeby&#39;s. \n\nSo, after a lot of research, and multiple visits to the drawing board, I&#39;ve come up with a formulation that I love! It is pleasing in consistency, very effective against odor, and good for the skin. The texture is a firm paste, that spreads easily on your skin, and feels skin silky and soft. It is quickly absorbed, and scented with the camphoraceous lift of Tea Tree and lemon pure essential oils. \n\nNatural deodorants contain no aluminum. Although the vegetable and clay powders will help to absorb moisture, it will not clog your pores to prevent sweat. Sweat doesn&#39;t bother me. I understand that it&#39;s a perfect cooling and detoxifying system. That being said, I work closely with people, and prefer to smell nice :)\n\nExtra-virgin, organic coconut oil possesses amazing antibacterial and anti-fungal properties, and is an effective deodorant all on it&#39;s own. Chamomile flower soothes, while the essential oils inhibit bacteria growth. \nZinc oxide is a naturally occurring mineral, used in diaper ointments, soothing skin salves, and natural sun-block. Combining these ingredients creates a deodorant that is more effective, and easier to use than plain coconut oil. A drop of beeswax prevents separation. \n\nUsing fingertips, gently massage a small, pea-sized chunk under each arm. A little goes a long way! I like to wait for it to absorb before I get dressed. \n \n**Of course, body chemistry differs from person to person, but this deodorant works better for me than anything I&#39;ve ever purchased. I recently received this email regarding it&#39;s efficacy:\n\n&quot;I bought this deodorant as an alternative to the chemicals in traditional deodorants.  I LOVE this creme deodorant - it rubs in so smooth, like silk and I was amazed when I recently took it to Japan for 10 days at the peak of summer.  Tokyo was consistently above 80% humidity and at least 85 degrees, but this deodorant worked great!   It even held up throughout 2 days of climbing Mt. Fuji (without reapplying) in the heat,  humidity and physical exertion.  VERY impressive!  I don&#39;t know how it does it, but it is amazing and I&#39;ll never switch to any other....thank you!!&quot;\n\nListing is for one flat, easy to open screw-top tin. Product weight is at least 2 oz.\n\nShipping:\nAll overages in excess of $1 will be refunded as soon as possible, please let me know if you paid an overage that was overlooked. Your purchase will be shipped to your Etsy address. All packages are shipped USPS Monday-Friday within 1-3 days of your payment.\n\nIngredients:\narrow root powder, baking soda, organic, extra-virgin coconut oil, kaolin clay, cocoa butter, beeswax, organic chamomile flower powder, zinc oxide, tea tree essential oil, lemon essential oil\n\n**A small percentage of the population is sensitive to baking soda. If you start to develop a rash, you may want to discontinue use. Some say your body will acclimate, and the rash is a result of your skin &#39;detoxifying&#39; from all the aluminum. \nI believe it&#39;s probably a combination of things. Baking soda tends to create a more alkaline environment, which is the reason bacteria and fungi will not grow there. This means your skin is going through a slight PH change, which can cause a temporary rash. Irritation can also be caused mechanically, by baking soda&#39;s rough edges. To off-set this, I buffer with plenty of other super soft, and soothing powders.\nI have been using this formula for months now, and have not experienced any problems with rash. None of my testers (all fully-consenting people, no animals) have reported any such issues. However, it&#39;s always best to do your own research, and product testing before use.","price":"8.00","currency_code":"USD"},{"id":197506973,"title":"Pilsner Beer Glass, Engraved Personalized Glassware Gifts, Set of 4, M30","images":["https://img0.etsystatic.com/040/0/7895312/il_75x75.631342590_kms2.jpg","https://img0.etsystatic.com/040/0/7895312/il_170x135.631342590_kms2.jpg","https://img0.etsystatic.com/040/0/7895312/il_570xN.631342590_kms2.jpg","https://img0.etsystatic.com/040/0/7895312/il_fullxfull.631342590_kms2.jpg"],"description":"An engraved pilsner beer glass is a cool custom barware gift for groomsmen, best man, wedding gift, Father&#39;s Day and is also a great birthday gift idea.

The thin blue line on black serves as a memorial, connection or memory between Officers killed in the line of Duty and those who continue with their duties in the present. \n\nPerfect gift for police wives... a pretty pair of earrings to wear to show their support, respect and awareness for the jobs their husband do.

It repels negative energy and enhances self-mastery. It helps us find our true path and erases fears. It brings happiness, good fortune, prosperity, strength, permanence, flair and self-control. Onyx is useful in difficult or confusing times of our lives, giving us peace of mind and personal joy. It is used to help break bad habits and protects us from the emotional roller-coaster ride caused by bothersome unhealthy relationships.

This listing is for both necklaces that come with a 30&quot; ball and chain necklace or a keychain. \n\nI can put whatever you like on them, just let me know! :) or if you&#39;d like to change the compass stamp, no problem just let me know! If it&#39;ll fit, I&#39;ll stamp it! ***Each item in my shop is handmade to order.  Every letter and design stamp you see is handstamped into the metal, so each item will be totally unique.  \r\n\r\n***My aluminum is 1100 pure 12 gauge food safe aluminum.  It will not tarnish or turn you green!  Wonderful for people to have metal allergies!  It even has a lower reaction rate than Sterling silver! \r\n\r\n***All of my copper and brass is 14 gauge.  These will oxidize over time, which will cause a unique antique look.  If you like the look of &quot;shinny&quot; copper and brass just polish it up with fine grit steel wool.  :)  \r\n\r\n***If you have any questions please let me know!

It is so strong that it would not bend out-of-round and it retains its shape permanently.\n\nScratch Resistance:\n\nCobalt chrome is harder than stainless steel, therefore, harder to scratch. Although not 100% scratch proof like tungsten carbide, cobalt chrome is much harder than titanium, and all precious metals including platinum, gold and silver.\n\nShatter Proof:\n\nCobalt wedding bands will never shatter or crack. Due to the fact that cobalt alloys are malleable, cobalt rings are shatter proof.\n\nPermanent Premium White Color:\n\nCobalt rings have color comparable to white gold and platinum jewelry. Moreover, since cobalt rings are not plated with rhodium, which will eventually wear off, they will retain its premium white color forever.\n\nHypoallergenic:\n\nThe same cobalt chrome material used to make surgical tools is used to make cobalt rings. They do not contain any harmful substances that would cause allergic reactions.\n\n\n-High Polish \n-Width-8mm \n-Beveled Edges\n-Pipe Cut\n-Blue Carbon Fiber Inlay\n-Comfort fit \n-0.05ct Natural Blue Sapphire\n-Cobalt\n-Lifetime Warranty\n-Sizes- 7-12 \n-Hypoallergenic\n-Free Ring Box\n\nFREE Custom Laser Engraving up to 65 Characters or Symbols. â¤ â â â¡ â\n\n\nSizes Available- 7,7.5,8,8.5,9,9.5,10,10.5,11,11.5,12\n\n*Lifetime Warranty*\n\nWe Offer Lifetime Warranty On Our Product.

Here my work is exhibited in a spacious 120qm area.\n\nI hope, you enjoy the journey through my world of colors and I thank you very much for looking.\n\nIf you have any questions or want me to send more photos, please contact me.

I LOVE these sky blue ones! Each opal has a sky blue base with flecks of pinks, yellow, green, blues and so much more! Every turn of the stone reflects and catches the light! The opal has been hand-set into a solid .925 Sterling silver setting and hangs from sterling silver chain. Chain is dainty yet strong. Closes with a sterling silver clasp. Stone measures 18mm tall (or just shy of 1&quot;) so they are a wonderful size and larger than most being sold out there. Please choose desired chain length at checkout. SO much prettier in person! \r\n\r\n*** What is a lab created opal? A lab created opal is an opal, grown in a lab setting, that has the same exact chemical composition as a genuine, mined from the Earth opal. The only difference is that these opals have one added ingredient. That ingredient makes the opal stronger and sturdier. Genuine opals are very soft and prone to fracture. These opals have all the beauty of a genuine opal without the high price tag!\r\n\r\nÂ© Copyright 2012 Hanging By A Thread, All rights reserved.\r\n\r\n****PLEASE SEE HOME PAGE FOR IMPORTANT SHIPPING INFO","price":"54.00","currency_code":"USD"},{"id":109586171,"title":"BG Originals Betsy&#39;s Dress pdf pattern","images":["https://img1.etsystatic.com/006/0/6158093/il_75x75.375664971_9iqp.jpg","https://img1.etsystatic.com/006/0/6158093/il_170x135.375664971_9iqp.jpg","https://img1.etsystatic.com/006/0/6158093/il_570xN.375664971_9iqp.jpg","https://img1.etsystatic.com/006/0/6158093/il_fullxfull.375664971_9iqp.jpg"],"description":"This is not your momma&#39;s peasant dress. :)\r\n\r\nNo siree Bob.

The 9x12 and 12x18 prints get within about 1/8â to the paper edge, which is great for framing.  The 16x24 and 24x36 are printed âfull bleedâ which means we print the image right to the paper edge, so there is no white border (unless itâs an odd proportion â for instance, if the image is square, and you purchase a 24x36 print, you will receive a 24x24 print).","price":"7.99","currency_code":"USD"},{"id":74669919,"title":"SALE!

These pieces, in the âTyneâ pattern, #2069, were made sometime between the 1930âs and 1950âs, by the English pottery maker, Salisbury, in Longton, Stoke-on-Trent.  Salisbury features lovely scrolls and florals in cobalt blue, rust, and yellow with gold trim.  There are no chips or cracks that I can find, only fine crazing due to age and use, and perhaps marks made during manufacture. There is some wear to the gold trim but the colors in the pattern are vivid and bright.  Please look at listing photographs and message me with any questions you might have. Considering its age and that it is âpre-lovedâ, it is still a lovely pattern and a beautiful vintage example of the fine potteries from the English, Stoke-on-Trent pottery era. \n\nThis would make a lovely gift for a china collector or anyone who yearns for the beauty of the past. I display it as a jewelry holder to show that it is a versatile tiered stand with many options!\n\nNote:  The jewelry shown in listing photographs is for display only and not included with purchase.\n\nAt the time of this listing, I also have a matching creamer jug and open sugar bowl of this Tyne, #2069, pattern.  Check in my vintage section for availability! \n\nApproximate dimensions: \nâ¢\tCup â 3 1/3â wide, 3 7/8â wide w/ handle, 2 Â¾â high\nâ¢\tSaucer â 5 3/8â wide\nâ¢\tBread and Butter Plate â 7â wide\n\nPlease include your phone number when ordering for FedEx shipping label. (Required by FedEx) If ordering other vintage china items from my shop, please contact me for combined shipping.\n\nTo maintain this setâs current vintage condition, hand washing only is recommended. Do not place in microwave, oven, or dishwasher.\n\nI do my very best to describe each item carefully, pointing out any flaws or other details I am aware of to help you make a purchase decision.

Lemon Balm&#39;s most popular use is in soothing herbal teas, where its lemon-scented volatile oils are released. Chopped fresh leaves are also good in salads, soups and stews. The dried leaves are also a perfect ingredient for potpourri and dream pillows. Lemon Balm is also known as Sweet Balm and a synonymous botanical name is Melissa officinalis.\nLemon Balm herb plants will bring the bees and hummingbirds to the garden! They love the fragrant flowers and fragrant heart-shaped leaves. At maturity, the herb plant reaches 12-24 inches tall and 12-18 inches wide. The Lemon Balm leaf can be picked at any time. Larger harvests can be obtained by snipping the upper half of the plant just above a node.\nHow To Grow Lemon Balm From Herb Seeds: Sow Lemon Balm seeds indoors 6 - 8 weeks before last frost. Use sterile starter mix, and sow the herb seeds on the surface. Do not cover the seeds. Transplant outdoors after frost danger has passed and seedlings have developed their second set of true leaves. For areas with a long growing season, directly sow Lemon Balm herb seeds outside in prepared soil.\n\nFor more check us out here!! https://www.etsy.com/shop/UnderTheSunSeeds","price":"2.50","currency_code":"USD"},{"id":228932594,"title":"Mandala Wall Decal Om Symbol Indian Pattern Vinyl Stickers Namaste Yoga Home Interior Design Art Murals Bedroom Decor (12ml01a)","images":["https://img0.etsystatic.com/061/1/10460320/il_75x75.753256752_cbna.jpg","https://img0.etsystatic.com/061/1/10460320/il_170x135.753256752_cbna.jpg","https://img0.etsystatic.com/061/1/10460320/il_570xN.753256752_cbna.jpg","https://img0.etsystatic.com/061/1/10460320/il_fullxfull.753256752_cbna.jpg"],"description":"Mandala Wall Decal Om Symbol Indian Pattern Vinyl Stickers Namaste Yoga Home Interior Design Art Murals Bedroom Living Room Decor\n\nWelcome to Our shop!\n\nVinyl stickers is a newest method to decorate interior or exterior of your home or office.

Sow Marigold seeds to have these large, showy, never fading orange blooms. They will brighten up any garden or flower bed! Tall Marigold flowers are reliable and easily grown from flower seed. The ease of sowing Marigold flower seeds make them popular for children to grow.\n\nMarigold plants will perform well in poor soil with good moisture. African Marigold care involves deadheading spent blooms to promote new flowers. They have a very long bloom season from late spring through fall in most regions. They burst with color all season long! Sow Marigold seeds 6 - 8 weeks before last frost. Use good starter soil and gently press Marigold flower seeds into the soil and lightly cover. When Marigold seedlings are big enough to handle and after acclimatizing the seedlings to outdoor conditions, transplant outdoors after frost danger has passed. Sierra orange Marigold seeds may also be sown directly outdoors after last frost in prepared beds. Marigolds bloom from flower seed in 8 - 10 weeks.\nFor more check us out here!! https://www.etsy.com/shop/UnderTheSunSeeds","price":"2.99","currency_code":"USD"},{"id":241572212,"title":"Teardrop Pendant","images":["https://img1.etsystatic.com/075/0/11004136/il_75x75.806179085_7ybs.jpg","https://img1.etsystatic.com/075/0/11004136/il_170x135.806179085_7ybs.jpg","https://img1.etsystatic.com/075/0/11004136/il_570xN.806179085_7ybs.jpg","https://img1.etsystatic.com/075/0/11004136/il_fullxfull.806179085_7ybs.jpg"],"description":"A beautiful olive green pendant wrapped in rustic wire.

When we speak about standing in our power, we speak of feeling centered, strong and resilient within the core of our Solar Plexus.\n\nCopper can conduct electrical impulses and can magnify the energy transfer, from the healer or from minerals, to the subject of the healing.

I cleanse you of all negative energies now.â\nBreathe deeply and then do three fast exhale breaths swiftly over your crystal pendant visualizing negative energy being blown away on the breath.\nTo activate your crystal pendant hold it in your hands, focus your intention and attention on it and say:\nâI dedicate this pendant to the highest good of all and ask its power be activated now to work in harmony with my own will and focused intention.â\nIf you have a specific purpose, add that to your dedication.\n\nPLEASE REVIEW MY SHOP POLICIES BEFORE PURCHASE.\n\nTo see more of my works go to\n\nhttp://www.silviapeluso.wordpress.com\n\nLove and Blessings,\nSilvia\n\nâ â â â â â â â â\nenter my shop here:\nsilviascreations.etsy.com\nâ â â â â ââ â â","price":"119.00","currency_code":"USD"},{"id":209326164,"title":"I Love You More, Custom Bracelet Cuff, Personalized Bracelet, Hand Stamped Cuff, Aluminum Cuff, Personalized Cuff, Adjustable Cuff, Jewelry","images":["https://img0.etsystatic.com/051/1/9543499/il_75x75.675476540_n2ey.jpg","https://img0.etsystatic.com/051/1/9543499/il_170x135.675476540_n2ey.jpg","https://img0.etsystatic.com/051/1/9543499/il_570xN.675476540_n2ey.jpg","https://img0.etsystatic.com/051/1/9543499/il_fullxfull.675476540_n2ey.jpg"],"description":"I LOVE YOU MORE\r\n\r\nPersonalized One Of A Kind Aluminum Hand Stamped Bracelet Cuff.\r\n\r\nThis listing is for one hand stamped aluminum bracelet cuff with &quot;I Love You More&quot; or a  word, name or phrase of your choice. \r\n\r\nCustomize Your Own Bracelet Cuff!
