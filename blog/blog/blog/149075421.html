<p><strong>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a great day&rdquo;</strong> for Rafa and his fans around the worldâ€¦Sadly, things didn&rsquo;t quite work out for our champ today, and as he said it himself a few days ago, <strong>&ldquo;you can&rsquo;t always win [everything].&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Robin Soderling was a man on a mission today, as he defeated Rafa in 4 sets, 6-2, 6-7, 6-4 y 7-6, after more than 3 hours of play.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;I have to accept with the same calm when I win than when I lose. After four years, I lose here, and the season continues,&quot;</strong> a gracious Rafa told a news conference.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Sure, he did well. He did very well but I didn't play my best tennis. I didn't play my tennis, and for that reason I lost. That's it,&quot;</strong> he said.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;I was not calm enough to face the important points, so I had to fight. But sometimes fighting is not enough. You have to play a good level of tennis.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&quot;Sometimes people think I win because I'm physically fit, but, no. When I win, it's because I play well, and that wasn't the case today.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Aside from the match itself, one of his biggest disappointments for Rafa was to see the lack of support from the Roland Garros crowd, who sadly, have never been too kind to the champion, <strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity to see that in a tournament as especial as [Roland Garros] is to me, the crowd has never had a nice gesture towards me.&quot; </strong></p>
<p>Moving on to the start of the grass season and his preparation for it, Rafa joked that the only preparation he will be worrying about any time soon, will be,<strong> &ldquo;[the time he will spend] at the pool of his house.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Before leaving to Mallorca, where he will be spending his birthday in the company of friends and family for the first time in many years, Rafa told the press that he would like to see Roger Federer win the title because, <strong>&ldquo;It would be great [to see him win it], so that he can complete the Grand Slam. If anybody deserves it, it&rsquo;s him,&rdquo;</strong> concluded Rafa. </p>
<p>Vamos Rafa!</p>
